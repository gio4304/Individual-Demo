# Facial Recognition
Overview

In this project we are using Google's Teachable Machine to train an AI model to recognize basic facial emotions. To do this, we turned on the webcam and recorded a bunch of images of ourselves making different faces, like happy, sad, angry, and neutral. Each emotion is its own category, and we added lots of examples for each one. We also tried to change things like our angle and lighting so the AI doesn’t just memorize one exact picture, but actually learns what each emotion generally looks like on a face.
